The releases are now combined into single releases.  You'll want the latest Cryptohaze-Combined release for your platform.

Note that, as of now, all the releases are 64-bit only.  It IS possible to build a 32-bit release, but the rainbow table tools will not work on large files as 32-bit binaries (memory mapping of large files cannot be done in 32-bit processes).  If you need a 32-bit Multiforcer, or a 32-bit table generation tool, it can be done.  If you would like to see 32-bit releases for some reason, let me know.
